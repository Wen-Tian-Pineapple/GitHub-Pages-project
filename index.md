## Me as a Programmer:

> I have been studying programming language for 3 years in college. During past 3 years, I learnt java, python, c, c++, system verilog, assembly and vhdl and spent a lot of time outside of class practicing them. Furthermore, I did an software engineering internship last summer in DongHua softerware in China, JiangXi, NanChang. As a conclusion, my career as a programmer just started.
